# Web-Scraping-in-python-Using-Beautiful Soup module
I wrote a python program which will access the IMDB website and then fetch the top rated movies present in the IMDB website and then load this data into an excel file.
IMDB website contains movie ratings but in this program we are only interested in scraping the top rated movies of all time only.
i am using 3 module in this program beautifulsoup module which is used to parse the HTML source code of the website, Requests module can be used to access the desired website and openpyxl to load the data into excel file.
